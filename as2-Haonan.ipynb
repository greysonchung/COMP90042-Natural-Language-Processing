    "<b>Materials</b>: See \"Using Jupyter Notebook and Python page\" on Canvas (under Modules>Resources) for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Gensim, Keras and Pytorch. We recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3.8</b>; libraries/packages should be in their latest version that is compatible with python3.8.  \n",

    "To familiarize yourself with NLTK, here is a free online book:  Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper (2009). <a href=https://www.nltk.org/book/>Natural Language Processing with Python</a>. O'Reilly Media Inc. You may also consult the <a href=https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html>NLTK API</a>.\n",

    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each question is worth is explicitly given. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",

    "<b>Academic misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the University’s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.

The test set should contain 1000 word types, and the rest should be in the  training set.

    "**Instructions:** The length of the secret word is an important clue that we might exploit. Different lengths tend to have different distributions over characters, e.g., short words are less likely to have suffixes or prefixes. You should incorporate this idea by conditioning the unigram model on the length of the secret word, i.e.,  having a **different unigram model for each length**. You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training. In such a case, your method should behave like the previous `unigram_guesser` in Question 3 (i.e., it guesses characters based on unigram frequencies, unconditioned by the word length).\n",

    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "- When backing-off to the unigram language model, you **must use the vanilla unigram language model that you have built in Q3**. Do not use the length-based unigram language model, or any fancy variant, or you will lose marks.\n",

On top of that, I also added the simple add-k smoothing method to better deal with unseen words in the test set, where k is a user assigned value. Fortunately, with these methods, I was able to improve the performance marginally compared to the standard bigram model.\n",
