# Automated Fact Checking For Climate Science Claims

## Project Detail
The impact of climate change on humanity is a significant concern. However, the increase in unverified state- ments regarding climate science has led to a distortion of public opinion, underscoring the importance of con- ducting fact-checks on claims related to climate science. It should not be difficult to see that the claim is not supported by the evidence passages, and assuming the source of the evidence is reliable, such a claim is misleading. The challenge of the project is to develop an automated fact-checking system, where given a claim, the goal is to find related evidence passages from a knowledge source, and classify whether the claim is supported by the evidence.
